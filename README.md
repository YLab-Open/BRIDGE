## BRIDGE (Benchmarking Large Language Models for Understanding Real-world Clinical Practice Text)

## üìú Background

Recent advances in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** have demonstrated transformative potential in **healthcare**,  yet concerns remain around their reliability and clinical validity across diverse clinical tasks, specialties, and languages. To support timely and trustworthy evaluation, building upon our [systematic review](https://ai.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/AIra2400012) of global clinical text resources, we introduce **[BRIDGE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19467)**, **a multilingual benchmark that comprises 87 real-world clinical text tasks spanning nine languages and more than one million samples**. Furthermore, we construct this leaderboard of LLM in clinical text understanding by systematically evaluating **52 state-of-the-art LLMs** (by 2025/04/29).

More Details can be found in our [BRIDGE paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19467) and [systematic review](https://ai.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/AIra2400012).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use?

#### 1. Download the BRIDGE Dataset
All fully open-access datasets in BRIDGE are available in [BRIDGE-Open](https://huggingface.co/datasets/YLab-Open/BRIDGE-Open). To ensure the fairness of this leaderboard, we publicly release the following data for each task: Five completed samples serve as few-shot examples, and all testing samples with instructions and input information. Due to privacy and security considerations of clinical data, regulated-access datasets can not be directly published. However, all detailed task descriptions and their corresponding data sources are available in our [BRIDGE paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19467). Importantly, all 87 datasets have been verified to be either fully open-access or publicly accessible via reasonable request.

#### 2. LLM Inference

- Put the downloaded data into the `dataset_raw` folder.
- Edit the `BRIDGE.yaml` file to specify the tasks you want to evaluate.
- Edit the `run.sh` file to specify the model you want to evaluate.
- Run the `run.sh` file to start the evaluation, which will automatically load the model and run inference on the specified tasks (`main.py`).

#### 3. Evaluation

- Result folder: All inference results will be saved in the `result` folder, which will be automatically created. The structure of the result folder is as follows: result -> task -> model -> experiment
- Result extraction: We develop an automated script for each task separately to extract results from the standardized LLM outputs; details can be found in the `dataset` folder: `classification.py`, `extraction.py`, and `generation.py`.
- Evaluation metrics: We provide an evaluation function for different tasks; details can be found in the `metric` folder: `classification.py`, `extraction.py`, and `generation.py`.
- Evaluation script: run `evaluate_BRIDGE.py` to evaluate all tasks. The performance of each task will be saved in the `performance` folder. 

#### 4. Update the Leaderboard

If you would like to submit your model results to BRIDGE and demonstrate its performance, please send the genereated `result` folder to us, and we will update the leaderboard accordingly. The leaderboard will be updated regularly, and we will notify you via email once your results are added.
